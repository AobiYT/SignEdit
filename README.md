## Permissions

All features of SignEdit for Bukkit will be available if the player has the following permission:

    SignEdit.use

(_since `v1.8.0`_) More refined permissions are available in this format:

    signedit.COMMAND.SUBCOMMAND

Examples:

    signedit.sign.cancel
    signedit.sign.clear
    signedit.sign.set
    signedit.sign.ui

## Configuration

All configuration is in the file `plugins/SignEdit/config.yml`.

(_since `v1.1`_) The configuration file is created with default values when the plugin is loaded and the file does not already exist.

(_since `v1.5.0`_) The configuration file is sanitized when the plugin is loaded and unloaded and rewritten when the plugin is unloaded.

### `clicking: [auto|false|true]`

_Added in `v1.1`_

(_since `v1.7.0`_) **auto** (default): Behave like `clicking: true` when you are not looking at a sign and behave like `clicking: false` when you are looking at a sign.

**false** (default _until `v1.7.0`_): Edit signs by looking at them and then typing a `/sign` command, which will then instantly edit the sign you are looking at.

**true**: Edit signs by typing a `/sign` command and then right-mouse clicking a sign.

### `line-starts-at: [1|0]`

_Added in `v1.5.0`_

**1** (default): Line number 1 corresponds to the top-most line of sign blocks.

**0**: Line number 0 corresponds to the top-most line of sign blocks.

## Features

* (_since `v1.8.0`_) Edit the targeted sign in the native Minecraft sign editor with `/sign ui`
  * No dependencies!
* Edit the line _line_ of the targeted sign to be _text_ with `/sign set <line> [<text>]` or (_since `v1.6.0`_) `/sign <line> [<text>]`
* All editing functions support formatting codes (`&` turns into `ยง`)
  ![Screenshot of color code in `/sign <line> <text>`](https://i.imgur.com/Cdv7p2t.png)
* Targeting a sign works as follows:
  * In `clicking: false` mode or in `v1.0`, the sign you are looking at is edited.
  * In `clicking: true` mode, after running the `/sign` command, right-click a sign to edit it.
  * (_since `v1.7.0`_) In `clicking: auto` mode, the behavior is the same as `clicking: false` if you are looking at a sign and `clicking: true` if you are not looking at a sign.
* (_since `v1.8.0`_) Before editing a sign, this plugin checks if the player is allowed to edit the sign by pretending to blank out the sign and seeing if the corresponding [SignChangeEvent](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/event/block/SignChangeEvent.html) is cancelled.

## Compatibility

This plugin is a fork of [Omel's SignEdit](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/signedit.25485/) v1.3.  Omel's SignEdit v1.3 and older are not compatible with Bukkit v1.12 and newer because a deprecated API method was removed ([see related issue in MyPet](https://github.com/xXKeyleXx/MyPet/issues/1033)).

Since this plugin does not use deprecated methods, it is expected to be compatible with Bukkit v1.7 and newer.

### Backwards Compatibility with Omel's SignEdit v1.3

SignEdit for Bukkit versions `>= 1.5.0, < 2.0.0` are backwards-compatible with Omel's SignEdit v1.3, but the following caveats apply:

* (_since `v1.5.0`_) By default, sign line numbers range from 1 to 4 in this plugin instead of 0 to 3 in the original plugin.

  To restore the original behavior and start line numbers at 0, set `line-starts-at: 0` in `plugins/SignEdit/config.yml`.
* (_since `v1.7.0`_) By default, `clicking` mode is activated when the player is not looking at a sign.

  To force `clicking` mode on at all times, set `clicking: true` in `plugins/SignEdit/config.yml`.

  To force `clicking` mode off at all times, set `clicking: false`.
* (_`v1.4.0` only_) Sign line numbers range from 1 to 4, whereas they ranged from 0 to 3 in older versions.

  Upgrade to SignEdit for Bukkit v1.5.0 to have the possibility of restoring the original line number range.
